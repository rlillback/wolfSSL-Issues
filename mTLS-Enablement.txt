Hi Daniel,

So you're aware, I've been able to make this work; as mtls is not supported out of the box for some reason.
Also, there isn't any wolfSSL documentation on getting mtls to work.
Here is what needs to be done to get it to work

Build libcurl as recommended;
Build wolfssl as recommended;
Create a function to install the trusted certificates in the wolfSSL context:

* CURLcode HTTP_wolfSSL_ctx_callback(CURL * curl, void * wolfSSLctx, void * arg)
* This function calls wolfSSL_CTX_load_verify_buffer
* This function also calls wolfSSL_CTX_set_cipher_list (if req'd)
* This function calls wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify to change the verification callback to the custom function below

Create a function that performs certificate verification from the server:

* int HTTP_wolfSSL_cert_verify_callback(int preverify_ok, WOLFSSL_X509_STORE_CTX * ctx)
* Use wolfSSL_X509 calls to verify what you want (e.g., subject name, issuer, start date, end date)

Inject the ctx_callback into cURL (the HTTP_wolfSSL_ctx_callback over-writes the standard wolfSSL_ctx_callback):

* (void)curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION, HTTP_wolfSSL_ctx_callback);

Then you can perform your curl call.

I thought you would like to document this in case someone else tries to do this.

Cheers --
